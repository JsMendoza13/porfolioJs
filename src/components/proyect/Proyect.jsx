            I have had the opportunity to participate in various projects and
            also to undertake some on my own. Below, I present a list of some of
            them.

              <h3>Project created in EPM âš¡</h3>
              <p>
                This project was created within a multinational company in
                Colombia, 'EPM.' It was developed using low-code tools such as
                PowerApps and Power Automate. It is an application designed for
                generating reports on assets.
